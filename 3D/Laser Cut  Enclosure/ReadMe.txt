These parts were fabricated from 3mm Black Acrylic and cut with a 2500 mWatt LED laser (which needed multiple passes).
The files were generally created with LightBurn, from patterns taken from the original Fusion 360 drawings.
Also the boxes were constructed from https://en.makercase.com/#/basicbox with a few tweaks.
